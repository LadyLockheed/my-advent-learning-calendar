`npm run dev` in prefered terminal to run project on localhost

## About this project

As we were getting closer to december and christmas I got the idea of building a small advent calendar. I wanted a fun project to work on, and at the same time motivate myself to read more articles and alike, related to Frontend developing or programming in general. Behind the doors, or panels, there will be a link/url to some page with interesting info about best practises, how commit messages should look like, imposter syndrome and a lot more.

It will consist of only frontend, and I will not publish it, so it will run only locally and using the localstorage as a database.

There will be a lot of things that will not be included in the project (or maybe it will, over time) such as tests and a real backend. Maybe I will add it in the future, but for now it will be a simple frontendproject, built just for fun and for practice.
